# Reproducibility Workflow :two_men_holding_hands: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Reproducibility in bioinformatics research is based on three facets;

   a) **Designing and planning for the research**
   - This involves organizing relevant literature using tools such as Mendeley, create project management environment using platforms such as the Open Science Network 
   and writing a data management plan.
   - Notes on the experiment an also be stored in an electronic lab notebook.
   
   b)  **Collecting and Analyzing Data**
   - This involves documentationn (use of literate programming tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown) and version control (using tools such as Git and GitHub).
   - Data like sequencing data can be clearly structured in spreadsheets with well indicated rows and columns.
   
   c) **Publishing and sharing your work**
   - This uses specific software that allows for collaborative efforts and open access asfter publishing.
