# Reproducibility Workflow

Reproducibility in bioinformatics research is based on three facets;

   a) **Designing and planning for the research**
   - This involves organizing relevant literature using tools such as Mendeley, create project management environment using platforms such as the Open Science Network 
   and writing a data management plan.
   
   b)  **Collecting and Analyzing Data**
   - This involves documentationn (use of literate programming tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown) and version control (using tools such as Git and GitHub)
   
   c) **Publishing and sharing your work**
   - This uses specific software that allows for collaborative efforts and open access asfter publishing.
