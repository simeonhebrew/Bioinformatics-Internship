# Genomic Data Management #

Data needs to be organized in a systematic way so that it is easier for the researcher to keep track all of the data produced from the study as well as make it possible
for collaborators to interact with the data efficiently.

I will point out three key levels of data management which are essential to the modern-day bioinformatician

- **Data tidiness**

Data should be clearly organized and structured in spreadsheets which will allow them to be successfully read through different programs.
The most important thing to note is that raw data should be left as raw data and should be never interfered with. This is because altering the raw data would mean that the
results of the study are tampered with and hence are not valid for analysis.

While using spreadsheets, all observations should be placed in their respective rows and the variables in their proper columns. THe column names should be
self-explanatory ad mutlitple elements should not be combined into one cell. The spreadsheet should be preferably saved in csv (comma separated values) format.
The metadata should be vividly explained, possibly through separate ReadMe files.

- **Documenting and organizing NGS projects**

In the case where large datasets are being used,proper planning, documenting and organizing of samples or datasets will  be needed
