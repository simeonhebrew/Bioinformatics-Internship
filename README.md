# Bioinformatics-Internship

Hello there! :sunglasses:

My name is Simeon Hebrew, a bioinformatics intern at the Molecular Biology and Bioinformatcs Unit (MBBU) at the International Centre For Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE).

I am very excited to begin this journey of learning the  *in silico* techniques necessary for handling biological data using bioinformatics pipelines and workflows. 
I am particularly keen to learn on how to develop algorithms and design computational simulations that are tailored to analyze how biological systems function in their natural state and when exposed to different environment. Hence,this has sparked a major in computational biology. 
I am also interested in experiencing the interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics which utilises computaional systems to make sense to biodata. This will also allow me to contribute to bridging the data annotation gap so that the rate at which biological data is produced can be equvalent to the rate at which it is analyzed and annotated for sensible research.


## Vision ##

`Long Term Vision`
To become an established computational biologist who is able to support human health research by developing algorithms and models that are needed to understand biological systems.

`Short Term Vision`
To contribute to the bioinformatics projects being carried out at ICIPE using the skills acquired and later apply for postgraduate programs in computational biology.
