# Bioinformatics-Internship

Hello there! :sunglasses:

My name is Simeon Hebrew, a bioinformatics intern and the Molecular Biology and Bioinformatcs Unit (MBBU) at the International Centre For Insect Physiology and ECology (ICIPE)

I am very excited to begin this journey of learning the  *in silico* techniques necessary for handling biological data using bioinformatics pipelines and workflows. I am particularly interested in experiencing the interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics which utilises computaional systems to make sense to biodata. This will also allow me to contribute to bridging the data annotation gap so that the rate at which biological data is produced can be equvalent to the rate at which it is analyzed and annotated for sensible research.


## Vision ##

`Long Term Vision`
To become an established computational biologist who is able to support human health research and contribute to academia.

`Short Term Vision`
To contribute to the mini-projects being carrie out at ICIPE apply for postgraduate programs incomputational biology using the skills that I will hav e gained after this internship training.
