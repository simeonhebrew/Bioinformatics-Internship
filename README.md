# Bioinformatics-Internship

Hello there! :sunglasses:

My name is Simeon Hebrew, a bioinformatics intern and the Molecular Biology and Bioinformatcs Unit (MBBU) at the International Centre For Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE)

I am very excited to begin this journey of learning the  *in silico* techniques necessary for handling biological data using bioinformatics pipelines and workflows. I am particularly interested in experiencing the interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics which utilises computaional systems to make sense to biodata. This will also allow me to contribute to bridging the data annotation gap so that the rate at which biological data is produced can be equvalent to the rate at which it is analyzed and annotated for sensible research.


## Vision ##

`Long Term Vision`
To become an established computational biologist who is able to support human health research in Africa and beyond by deisgning analysis workflows tailored to needs of the research activity.

`Short Term Vision`
To efficiently contribute to the bioinformatics projects being carried out at ICIPE and later apply for postgraduate programs in bionformatics/computational biology using the skills acquired.
